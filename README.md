# Hassan Tarek Portfolio

A visually rich, modern, and fully responsive portfolio for a senior full stack developer and IT administrator. Built with pure HTML, CSS (custom properties, advanced keyframes, and HSL color logic), and vanilla JavaScript. Designed for clarity, vibrancy, and performance‚Äîno frameworks or animation libraries required.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Robotic Hand Animation:**
  - SVG robotic hand holding a glowing `</>` symbol, centered in the background.
  - Hand and symbol pulse with smooth, color-cycling neon glows (HSL-based, dark-mode friendly).
  - All color transitions are continuous and logic-driven‚Äîno hardcoded color values.

- **Floating Code Particles:**
  - Animated code keywords and symbols (e.g., `if`, `const`, `{}`) drift, rotate, and fade in the background.
  - Each particle cycles through harmonious hues and glows for visual clarity.

- **Mist/Cloud Effect:**
  - Subtle, blurred mist at the bottom of the viewport.
  - Mist responds to scroll with a horizontal parallax effect.

- **UI Animations:**
  - Sections fade/slide in as they enter the viewport.
  - Navbar dynamically styles on scroll (solid background, blur, shadow).
  - Buttons, links, cards, and interactive elements feature soft neon glows, color-shifting, and scale/hover effects‚Äîall using CSS variables and transitions.

- **Performance & Accessibility:**
  - All animations are GPU-accelerated and use only CSS3/JS (no heavy libraries).
  - Reduced motion support for accessibility.
  - No layout shifts, FOUC, or will-change abuse.
  - Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5** (semantic, accessible)
- **CSS3** (custom properties, HSL color logic, advanced keyframes, modular BEM naming)
- **SVG** (robotic hand asset, scalable and animated)
- **JavaScript** (modular, ES6+, no dependencies)

## üñºÔ∏è Visual System

- **Color System:**
  - All color transitions use CSS variables and HSL logic for theme-wide harmony.
  - Color cycling is handled by keyframes animating CSS variables, making it easy to tune the palette.

- **Animation System:**
  - Modular, with all effects (background, particles, UI) coordinated via CSS and JS.
  - No hardcoded color values‚Äîeverything is logic-based and theme-consistent.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
assets/
  hand.svg                # SVG for robotic hand and code symbol
css/
  animations.css          # All animation, color-cycling, and hover/glow effects
  main.css                # Layout, typography, and component styles
  variables.css           # CSS custom properties (theme, spacing, etc.)
js/
  main.js                 # Modular animation system, particles, scroll/hover logic
index.html                # Main HTML file (semantic, modular, BEM classes)
README.md                 # This file
```

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone or download the repo.**
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
3. To deploy, simply push to GitHub Pages or any static host.

## üìù Customization
